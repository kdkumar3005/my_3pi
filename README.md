# Template for the Lingua Franca RP2040 target platform
This repo is a template for [Lingua Franca](https://www.lf-lang.org/) (LF) projects using the bare metal RP2040 target platform such as found on the [Raspberry Pi Pico board](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) and the [Pololu 3pi+ 2040 robot](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J86).
This template is particularly well suited for the [LF Embedded Lab](https://www.lf-lang.org/lf-embedded-lab/) exercises.
Students should create a repository using this template and record their work within their repo.

The repo supports MacOS, Linux, and Windows through [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
To support RP2040-based boards, the repo uses the [Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/tree/master) as a submodule.
It also includes some code from the [pololu-3pi-2040-robot library](https://github.com/pololu/pololu-3pi-2040-robot/tree/master) by DavidEGrayson.

See the [installation instructions](https://www.lf-lang.org/lf-embedded-lab/Installation.html) to get started.



## Building
Lingua Franca applications are code generated into the target language. To both code generate and build application binaries one can either use lfc or lingo. Lingo ultimately uses lfc as a backend but provides an additional experimental interface for managing multiple application binaries builds.

### LFC
LFC is the main lingua franca compiler used for code generation. Install a nightly version of the [tool chain](https://github.com/lf-lang/lingua-franca/releases/tag/nightly) since RP2040 support is not in an official release.

After installation, run ``lfc`` in the root directory on the application of your choice.
``` bash
lfc src/Blink.lf
```
An application binary will be populated in the ``/bin`` directory with the same name as the source file. The source code for the application after code generation will be in the ``/src-gen`` folder.

## Flashing
Before flashing the binary to your rp2040 based board, the board must be placed into ``BOOTSEL`` mode. On a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) this can be entered by holding the ``RESET`` button while connecting the board to the host device.

The [picotool](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool) application installed in the nix shell is an easy way to interact with boards.
With the application you can check what programs are currently flashed and can directly load program binaries. Run ``picotool help`` for more information on its capabilities.


Run the following to flash an application binary on to your board.
``` shell
picotool load -x bin/Blink.elf
```

## Serial
Standard IO output can be redirected to be hosted across either a usb connection or pins connected to a uart peripheral. This option is specified by modifying the `platform` target option. Use the board field to specify the `<board_name>:"uart" "usb"`, where `uart` will redirect the stdio signal to the hardware pins for the particular board. Board options can be found [here](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/tree/master/src/boards/include/boards)

```
target C {
    platform: {
        name: "RP2040",
        board: "pico:uart"
    },
    ...
}
```

Once flashed, open a minicom session using the following command and replace the COM string with the platform specific COM Port string. The following is a MacOS example.

```shell
minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/cu.usbmodem1234
```

Exit minicom with `CTRL-A` and `X`


## Emulator
To run basic smoke tests and monitor GPIO, UART and other supported peripherals, a nodejs based emulator is provided in this repo. During the nix shell setup for the repo, the node modules in the ``/test`` directory are installed. 

These are the currently supported peripherals the emulator has integration with. More information can be found [here](https://docs.wokwi.com/parts/wokwi-pi-pico)
By default, the emulator uses **hex** binaries which are generated by both build options. Any hex files that are in need of testing must be placed in the ``/target/hex/`` directory. This will automatically be done by *lingo*.

Run the following from the ``/test/`` directory. It will run an emulator instance for each hex file in the ``hex`` directory in parallel and report results as plain text files.
``` bash
cd test/
npm start
```
The text framework source code is available and can be easily extended. Currently, a test is set to report a **FAILING** status if it does not terminate within 10 seconds but this condition can be altered.
